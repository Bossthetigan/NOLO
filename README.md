Quick overview
NOLO targets real-time AI-assisted PTZ control with streaming. The pipeline starts with a video feed from a camera or webcam. A vision module runs an object detector to identify targets of interest. A tracking module estimates motion and predicts trajectories. A PTZ controller adjusts the camera to keep the target centered and framed. A streaming module publishes the video with overlays to local display or network endpoints. All components are designed to be modular, so you can swap detectors, trackers, or streaming backends with minimal changes to the rest of the system.

Core features
- Real-time object detection and tracking: NOLO uses modern, fast detectors such as YOLO variants and lightweight alternatives to balance speed and accuracy in real-world scenes.
- PTZ integration: The PTZ module translates tracking results into smooth pan, tilt, and zoom commands. It supports hardware controllers via serial, network, and GPIO interfaces.
- Live streaming: Output can be streamed to a local window, a network stream, or embedded into custom dashboards. The streaming engine integrates with FFmpeg for robust media handling.
- Go-based core with OpenCV bindings: The core uses Go for performance and simplicity, with GoCV to access OpenCV features for preprocessing and visualization.
- Extensible architecture: Each major subsystem (AI, vision, streaming, PTZ) exposes well-defined interfaces, enabling easy replacement and experimentation.
- Cross-platform support: Targeted for Windows, Linux, and macOS. Embedded and edge deployments are supported with lightweight build configurations.
- Documentation and examples: The repository provides end-to-end examples, sample configs, and runnable tutorials to help you learn quickly.
- Community and ecosystem: The project aligns with common AI, computer vision, and video processing ecosystems and supports integration with external tools like YouTube workflows and other streaming platforms.

How NOLO works
NOLO orchestrates several layers to achieve accurate tracking and smooth camera control:
- Input layer: Accepts video sources from USB webcams, IP cameras, or pre-recorded streams. The input layer normalizes frames and timestamps for downstream components.
- Vision layer: Runs object detectors to identify targets of interest. It also handles image preprocessing steps such as resizing, color space conversion, and normalization.
- Tracking layer: Maintains trajectories, estimates velocities, and predicts short-term positions to enable proactive camera motion. It uses a fusion of detection results and motion models to keep the target centered.
- Control layer: Translates tracking data into PTZ commands. It handles calibration data, pan/tilt limits, velocity constraints, and smoothing filters to avoid jitter.
- Streaming layer: Renders overlays, encodes video, and streams to local displays or network endpoints. It leverages FFmpeg or native streaming backends for compatibility.
- Orchestrator: Coordinates all layers with clean lifecycle management, error handling, and metrics collection. It provides configuration reloading and graceful shutdown.

Hardware and software requirements
- Operating system: Windows, Linux (x86_64), macOS. Embedded targets supported with cross-compilation.
- Go toolchain: Go 1.19+ (adjustable per release).
- C/C++ dependencies: OpenCV, FFmpeg, libjpeg, libpng, zlib (or system equivalents), and OpenCV bindings for Go (GoCV).
- Camera hardware: PTZ-enabled cameras supporting pan, tilt, and zoom with a controllable interface (serial, USB, or network).
- PTZ controller compatibility: Serial over USB, SPI, or Ethernet-based control protocols. Pinouts and wiring must match your hardware.
- Optional GPU acceleration: NVIDIA GPUs via CUDA for faster inference. CPU fallback is supported for small-scale setups.
- RAM and CPU: A modest workstation will handle basic tracking; real-time performance improves with more cores and memory.
- Network: If streaming to a remote endpoint, ensure bandwidth and latency are suitable for your application.
